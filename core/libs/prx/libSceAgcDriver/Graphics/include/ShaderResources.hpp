// together (APS5_RESOURCE_CACHE_ENTRIES, default 1024); the map has its own mutex and locks itself:
// VulkanDevice::PrepareDispatch probes it without GuestMemory::GpuMutex (a hit there is revalidated
// under the lock by the dispatch; inserts and Revalidate stay under it). Compute keys start with the

// the headless device with the windowed one while workers may still hold the old one, so a replaced
// device's entries (whose descriptor sets and pooled buffers belong to it) are unreachable by key
// and dropped by that device's Clear(). APS5_NO_RESOURCE_CACHE=1 (dispatches) and
// APS5_NO_DRAW_RESOURCE_CACHE=1 (draws) build every object as before; the device clears the cache at
