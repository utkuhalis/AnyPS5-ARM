## The AnyPS5 app

**AnyPS5.app** turns a game folder into a Mac app in four clicks: no Terminal, no build. [⬇ Download](https://github.com/utkuhalis/AnyPS5-ARM/releases/latest/download/AnyPS5-macOS.zip) · [How to use it](docs/user/GUIDE.md#the-anyps5-app)

## About

AnyPS5-ARM is the macOS port of [AnyPS5](https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5). AnyPS5 is not an emulator: its relinker turns a PS5 executable into a native program, and its system libraries are reimplemented as ordinary shared libraries the program links against. On Apple silicon:

- **CPU:** the game's x86-64 code runs under **Rosetta 2**. A [native arm64 mode](https://github.com/utkuhalis/AnyPS5-ARM/blob/native-arm64/docs/dev/NATIVE_ARM64.md) without Rosetta is in development on the `native-arm64` branch.
- **Executable:** the relinker writes a **Mach-O** executable.
- **Graphics:** the PS5 graphics driver runs on **Vulkan through MoltenVK**, which runs on Metal.
- **Distribution:** the result is a normal **`.app`** you open from Finder.

Built on [boykopovar/AnyPS5](https://github.com/boykopovar/AnyPS5) and the community macOS port [mugurc/AnyPS5 `macos-port`](https://github.com/mugurc/AnyPS5/tree/macos-port).
